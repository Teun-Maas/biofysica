% Calibrate speakers
% 
% A calibrator (from B&K or ACO) typically has an output level of 94 dB SPL
% (for the output tone of 1000 Hz).
% Why 94 dB SPL? This corresponds to 1 Pa
% How so?
% dB is defined as 20 * log10 (P1/Pref) where Pref is a reference level
% By convention (sound pressure level), the Pref is set to 20 muPa (0.00002
% or 2e-5 Pa), which is approximately the audible theshold for humans for a
% 1000 Hz tone.  This threshold is thus set to 0 dB SPL,
% 20 *% log10(2e-5/2e-5) = 
% 20*log10(1) = 
% 20(0) = 
% 0
% 
% Now setting the pressure level to 1 Pascal:
% 20*log10(1/2e-5)=
% 93.9794 dB
