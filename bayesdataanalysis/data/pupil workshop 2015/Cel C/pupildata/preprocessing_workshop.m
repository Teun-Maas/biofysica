% In this script blinks are removed and traces are smoothed. Traces 
% containing to many blinks are excluded. The output provides an average 
% trace that is baseline corrected.
% The following processing steps are performed.
% PREPROCESSING  Collects pupil traces from the raw data set and
%                creates a list that codes for valid and invalid traces
%                based on the percentage of blinks.
% LINEAR INT     Fills in gaps created by blinks.
%                Note that blinks will also create gaps in eye-movement 
%                data. This is not covered in this workshop.
% MOVING AVE     Moving average filter for smoothing data.
% BASELINE COR   Baseline correction is preferment for each trace.
% AVERAGING      Average over all traces is calculated.
