Your MF1 speaker kit includes a USB jump drive with calibration curves specific to your speakers that were made during final testing at TDT. If you purchased BioSigRZ, you will have generic calibration files for these speakers automatically installed on your PC (C:\TDT\BioSigRZ\TCF) when you install the software. 

If you are using these speakers above 30kHz, in free field mode, TDT recommends using these files in place of the generic files for your calibration.
